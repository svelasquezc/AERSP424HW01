This is the first homework for Penn State AERSP 424: Advanced Computer Programming - Fall 2023.

The repository is distributed as Follows:

- The include folder has two subfolders:
    - Aircraft: this folder accounts for questions 1 to 3, but it is definitions only, the actual implementation is found in src.
    - Classifier: this folder accounts for the neuron implementation required for questions 4 to 9.

- The src folder only has Aircraft implementations, also main.cpp doesn't have anything.

- The actual answers to the questions are found as tests in the tests folder.
